                    Hello ðŸ‘‹ <br />
                    My name is Daquan Johnson, a software engineer based in New York, NY.
                    I enjoy working in and contributing to the digital space by way of web developement!
                    I'm a front end focused developer with experience in modern backend technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I held a long time interest in software, the web and how it all worked.
                    I learned about <a href="https://perscholas.org/courses/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Per Scholas </a>, a non-profit technical bootcamp and
                    In June of 2020 I completed their 15 week software engineering course. Giving myself an opportunity to materialize that interest.
                    Shortly after graduating I was invited back to join the new co-horts as an associate Instructor.
                    Through pair programming, debugging, facilitating course material and project building, I have helped to give others a shot at tech and continue to further my skillset as a developer.
